Hi All,

Congratulations on completing the class! I was really pleased to see all of the active discussions!! 

I wanted to share an open source sand box environment of a chemical processing plant that we developed in my group a few years ago and have been maintaining. You can practice hacking it and causing the chemical reactor to explode :).

Here's a link to the GitHub site: https://github.com/djformby/GRFICS
